## How it works

### General Configuration

The **top 3 rows** are showing the items you need to craft for each task. <br>
Click the corresponding **dye** to **enable** (green) or **disable** (gray) a specific task. <br>
Click the **book** icon to **configure the crafting task** in detail.

### Configuring a Crafting Task
The **top row** sets the crafting goals â€” the items the player needs to craft. <br>
The **bottom three rows** list the items you have in your inventory while crafting the goal item(s) <br>
Click **`Delete`** to delete the crafting task <br>
Click **`Save`** to save your changes <br>
Click **`Exit`** to go back to the general configuration <br>
Click **`Load from Inventory`** to load the items from your inventory into the chest <br>
Click **`Copy to Inventory`** to copy the items from the chest into your inventory <br>
<br>

To start practicing click the **`Start`** sign above the crafting table. A random craft will be selected and shown in your hotbar. After finishing one craft the time it took is displayed in the chat and the next craft starts right after.
