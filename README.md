# Searchcraft-Practice
 
Map for practicing search crafting / book crafting in Minecraft

## How it works

To start practicing click the `Start` sign above the crafting table. A random craft will be selected and shown in your hotbar. After finishing one craft the time is displayed in the chat and the next craft starts right after.

## Configuraton

You can configure your crafts using the chest.

Each column in the chest represents one craft. The top 3 slots show which item(s) will need to be crafted, clicking the **dye** will **enable/disable** that craft and the **book** is used to **configure the items**.

In the item configuration menu the **single row** at the top sets the **crafting goals** and the **3 rows** at the bottom set the **resources** that will be given to the player. All the items are fully customizable.
