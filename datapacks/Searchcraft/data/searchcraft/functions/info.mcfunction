# Use the chest below to configure your crafting recipes. Each column represents one recipe. The top 3 slots show which item(s) will need to be crafted, clicking the dye will enable/disable the recipe and the book is used to configure the items.

# In the item configuration menu the single row at the top sets which items will need to be crafted and the 3 rows at the bottom are for the resources the will be given to the player. All of that is fully customizable.
